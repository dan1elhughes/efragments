# The squirrel

_19 March 2003_

As he turned the corner into his own street, a grey squirrel half way across the road became suddenly aware of his approach, and changed its mind about crossing the road.  If it had kept running, it would have easily escaped the wheels of the car.  But it turned back, instead, making for the shelter of the verge it had just left.  Tony was determined not to cause an accident by swerving to avoid this vermin.  But at the moment of impact, his arms and neck froze in a paroxysm of horror at the thought of what these wheels would do to this innocent creature, contrasted with the thought of a multi-car collision ensuing from evasive action. But he kept to his planned direction and tensed up, waiting for the thump of the tyre on the squirrel, there was none.  He passed over the position of the squirrel, checked his mirror, and there was no squirrel, alive or dead.  Odd, he thought, shrugged, and carried on home.<br>
